[Plaid Documentation](https://plaid.com/docs/api)

## Usage

Add to your dependencies in `mix.exs`. The hex specification is required.

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:plaid, "~> 1.4", hex: :plaid_elixir}]
end
```

## Configuration

All calls to Plaid require either your client id and secret, or public key. Add the
following configuration to your project to set the values.

```elixir
config :plaid,
  root_uri: "https://development.plaid.com/",
  client_id: "your_client_id",
  secret: "your_secret",
  public_key: "your_public_key",
  httpoison_options: [timeout: 10_000, recv_timeout: 30_000]
```

By default, `root_uri` is set by `mix` environment. You can override it in your config.
- `dev` - development.plaid.com
- `prod`- production.plaid.com

Finally, you can pass in custom configuration for [HTTPoison](https://github.com/edgurgel/httpoison). It's recommended you
extend the receive timeout for Plaid, especially for retrieving historical transactions.

## Obtaining Access Tokens

Access tokens are required for almost all calls to Plaid. However, they can only be obtained
using [Plaid Link](https://plaid.com/docs/link/transition-guide/#creating-items-with-link).

Once a user successfully connects to his institution using Plaid Link, a
public token is returned to the client. This single-use public token can be exchanged
for an access token and item id (both of which should be stored) using
`Plaid.Item.exchange_public_token/1`.

Consult Plaid's documentation for additional detail on this process.

## Compatibility

As of version `1.2`, this library natively supports serialization of its structs using `Jason` for compatibility with Phoenix.

## Tests and Style

This library uses [bypass](https://github.com/PSPDFKit-labs/bypass) to simulate HTTP responses from Plaid.

It uses Elixir's native formatter as of `1.3.2`
